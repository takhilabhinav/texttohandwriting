<h1 align="center"> Text to Handwriting Conversion Utility Through <b>PYTHON</b> Script </h1>
<h4 align="center"> A streamlined Approach to <a href="https://github.com/sharanya02/Text-file-to-handwritten-pdf-file"> Sharanya's</a> project<h4>
  
  <p>
  This project was developed to streamline the process of <a href="https://github.com/sharanya02/Text-file-to-handwritten-pdf-file"> Sharanya's</a> python script that converts a .txt file to a handwritten PDF. However, I have taken the liberty to upload my own handwriting and built a VERY simple utility that would convert any .txt file to my handwritten PDF.
 
  </p> <br>
  
#Workings:
  - This Utility executes the python script on the server itself.
  - The server has all the dependencies pre-installed in the proper directory according to  <a href="https://github.com/sharanya02/Text-file-to-handwritten-pdf-file/blob/master/README.md"> THESE</a> instructions.
  - Users upload a .txt file into the server
  - The system checks for the correct file format.
  - The file is then fed into the script and the output is then generated and prepped for download.
  
  <br><br>
  
#Future Scope:
- Custom handwriting upload IS possible.
- A database to upload multiple files and download multiple files at the same time could very well be implemented.

<br><br>

#Web Application Code Files:
  - index.html
  - index.css
  - upload.php
  - download.php
  
  <br><br>

#How To Setup:
  - Clone my repo in your server folder (I used my localhost).
  - In that folder install the necessary environmental dependencies according to the instructions provided <a href="https://github.com/sharanya02/Text-file-to-handwritten-pdf-file/blob/master/README.md"> HERE </a>. (JUST THE PRE-REQUISITES) 
  - Note that you dont need to download the files in the python repo should you choose to clone mine. JUST FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO INSTALL THE PRE-REQUISITES.
  - Run the index.html file (in case of localhost).

#PreCaution:
I am NOT uploading this to a proper server with all the added functionalities because there is a huge chance of misusing this amazing project.
Please use it at your own discretion.
